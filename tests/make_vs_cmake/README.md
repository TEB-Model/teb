This simple regression test checks whether the results produced with the new version of TEB (after refactoring) are identical to those produced with the previous version. Tests are based on inputs and configuration from the CAPITOUL case.

### Assumptions

Ubuntu, GNU Fortran compiler, and Python 3.6+. All commands are executed from the current location.

### Intructions

```sh
./run_test.sh
